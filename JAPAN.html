      <P style="font-size:150%;border-bottom:10ch;"><strong>I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND ABOUT MY FAVORITE PLACES IN JAPAN.</strong></P>
      <h2><strong>AROUND TOKYO</strong></h2>
      <p style="font-size:150%;">1.ASAKUSA ー浅草ー</p>
      <p>Asakusa is the first place that comes to mind when one thinks of places to recommend to tourists!!
        You can rent and wear kimonos so you cand feel the Japanese tradition. Here are some popular spots around Asakusa.</p>
        <img src="![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112539110/196084952-d2077651-bb2c-4c2e-9ace-430f57d98b71.jpeg)" height="240">

        <h4>&nbsp;①Sensoji Temple ー浅草寺ー</h4>
      <p>Sensoji Temple is the oldest temple in Tokyo with a history of nearly 1,400 years. It is the head temple of the Sho-Kannon sect of Buddhism and enshrines Sho-Kannon Bosatsu (the "Secret Buddha") in its main hall.
        The main gate, Kaminarimon, is one of the most popular photo spots in Asakusa. 
        It is crowded every day with many tourists from home and abroad. Since its construction, the Kaminarimon has been repeatedly destroyed by fire and rebuilt.
        The present Kaminarimon was donated by Konosuke Matsushita, founder of Panasonic (then Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.), in 1960. 
        The current Kaminarimon was donated by Konosuke Matsushita, the founder of Panasonic (then Matsushita Electric), in 1960. According to the legend of Sensoji Temple, a golden dragon appeared from the sky three days after the apparition of Kannon, and there is a connection with dragons. The bottom of the large lantern of the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate) is decorated with a dragon sculpture, and the backs of the statues of the Wind God and Thunder God on either side enshrine the Dragon God, who presides over water. 
        It is recommended that visitors enjoy sightseeing while spotting the dragons on the ceiling of the water shed and main hall, on the bottom of the lanterns of the Hozomon gate, and in other places on the temple grounds. If you would like to avoid the crowds and enjoy a leisurely tour of the temple grounds, why not visit after the stores along Nakamise-dori on the approach to the temple are closed? The lights at night are fantastic and create a dignified atmosphere that differs from that of the daytime.

        <h4>&nbsp;②Nakamise St. ー仲見世通りー</h4>
      <p>Nakamise street, said to be one of the oldest shopping streets in Japan, appears immediately after passing through the Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate). 
        The 250-meter approach to the street is lined with 89 stores selling Asakusa's typical handicrafts, folk crafts, sweet stores, and more.
      </p>  
        <img src="![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112539110/196086029-b41ad9ba-3425-4354-a2c1-abacc565ac1f.jpeg)" height="240">

        <h4>&nbsp;③Denboin Street ー伝法院通りー</h4>
      <p>On the west side of the Nakamise is Denboin, the main temple of Sensoji. 
        The street in front of it is "Denboin-dori.
        A gatepost in the middle of Nakamise Dori with the sign "Denboin Dori" marks the street. 
        The 200-meter-long street is lined with stores with tiled roofs lining the eaves, giving it an Edo-style atmosphere. 
        Enjoy strolling along the street while checking out the street lamps called "jiguchi andon," which depict fashionable Edo period sayings, and discovering "Shiranami Gonin Otoko," a bandit hero who appears in Kabuki plays, and "Nezumi Kozo," a rat boy.

        <h4>&nbsp;④The Star Square ースターの広場ー</h4>
      <p>The Asakusa Public Hall is located at the corner of Denboin Street and Orange Street. 
        In front of the entrance of the hall and on the sidewalks of the street are lined with the handprints of famous people who have contributed to the development of popular entertainment. 
        The first handprint is that of Hibari Misora, a great star of the Showa period. 
        Many other handprints are also displayed in the plaza, including those of Tetsuya Watari, Beat Takeshi, Kirin Kiki, and kabuki actors from Naritaya and Nakamuraya. 
        You can match them with your own hands and check the palms of celebrities. The number of handprints of people who have been active is increasing every year, so it is worth seeing.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:150%;">2.DISNEY RESORT</p>
      <img src="![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112539110/196096662-b45348f2-e5f4-474f-9c24-48e39e42cf4c.jpeg)" height="240">
      <p>Disney Resort is a place where even those who can't ride roller coasters can have fun. The scenery is very scenic, so you can take pretty pictures wherever you want. I recommend going to Disneyland on the first day, staying at a hotel in Disney, and then going to DisneySea on the second day.</p>
      <h4>①Disney Land and Sea ーディズニーランド＆ディズニーシーー</h4>
      <img src="![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112539110/196103195-de649b04-ae2d-467a-8173-60962add971f.jpeg)" height="240">
      <img src="![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112539110/196103293-6dab15be-56a5-4e6f-aa6a-fad7318628c2.jpeg)" height="240">
      <p>
      I think Disneyland has more rides than DisneySea. There are also many rides for children, so I recommend it for families with small children.
      DisneySea has a lot of rides for adults, and a lot of romantic scenic art, so i'd recommend it for a date!
      Here are some of the best ways to have fun I always do when I go to Disney.
      <br>・First, install the official Disney app.
      <br>・When you enter, you enter first thing in the morning. If you don't do that, you won't be able to ride the attractions you want to ride and you will have to wait most of the time. You should line up at least an hour before the show starts.
      <br>・After you enter the park, you should buy the hairband. I recommend buying matching ones for friends and family. Your photos will look 100 times prettier just by wearing these.
      <br>・Beauty and the Beast and Baymax rides (disney land) and Soarin and Tower of Terror (disney sea) are very popular. Many people want to ride first thing in the morning, so it is likely to be crowded right after the show starts. So it is better to aim for lunch time or just before the park closes.
      <br>・If you want to play the games and meet the characters in Disneyland you need to make a reservation. This reservation can only be made once you are inside the park. This is very popular so we recommend making reservations as soon as you enter the park.
      <br>・It's about meal. I usually have brunch at 10:00 and dinner at 17:00 because it is very crowded and you have to wait for a long time if you go there during lunch or dinner time. If you want to eat meal at exact time, it is best to make a reservation at the restaurant as well.
      <br>・Souvenir shops are all crowded after 20:00. Therefore, it is best to go there after lunch. You can check the official Disney app to see what souvenirs are available in the parks, so it's a good idea to check what you want.
      </p>
      <h4>②Disney Hotel ーディズニーホテルー</h4>
      <p>There are four hotels I would recommend. All of the hotels are located near Disney and offer shuttle bus transportation. I also recommend staying at one of the hotels because you get a ticket that allows you to enter the park earlier than others.
         <br>・TOKYO DISNEY LAND HOTEL→

      <p>3.SHIBUYA</p>
      <p>Shibuya is one of the twenty-three city wards of Tokyo, but often refers to just the popular shopping and entertainment area found around Shibuya Station.
        As one of Tokyo's big youth culture hubs, there are also some hip and trendy dining options.   
        Shibuya is a center for youth fashion and culture, and its streets are the birthplace to many of Japan's fashion and entertainment trends. 
        Over a dozen major department store branches can be found around the area catering to all types of shoppers. Most of the area's large department and fashion stores belong to either Tokyu or Seibu, two competing corporations.
        I used to go to Shibuya after school to go shopping, go to cafes, and see movies.
        Here are some my recommended cafes.
